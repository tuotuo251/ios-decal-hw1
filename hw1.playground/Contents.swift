//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance

    //: Yes


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(_ words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reversed())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for i in 0 ... numElements-1 {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }

//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: 1)Because we should replace ..< with ... in the problem, also we need to adjust the index for for loop since we need to loop from 0 to len -1
//: 2)Since in the test codes, arePalindromes are used as a class function, therefore we need to add a class in front of func to make it
//: a class function.
//: 3)When debugging, we found that it is missing a return statement.
